# Cross Asset Deal Enabler Platform (CADEP) — What is written on the box
"Our biggest enemy isn’t the market. It’s our own latency. Clients don’t wait for us to paper docs, check credit, or argue across desks. CADR changes that."
"Our 2nd biggest enemy, is solving the same problem 10 different ways in silos. This platform is not the coming of Christ where it will revolutionize what is engrained in Banking culture, but it will atleast keep our platform scalable and future proof.

**The What - Key Problems Today:**  
- Legal docs (ISDA / CSA / Annexes) stall trades for days. A good POC deliverable put into place to solve it. POC is being scaled across without taking a step back.  
- Sales quotes blind because credit limits aren’t visible pre-trade.  - With the large tech initiative mandated by the firm to adopt Data Mesh, all tech teams such as Credit/Derivatives/Manta/etc. can easily collaborate and strategically integrate solutions with higher velocity and lower over-engineering/tech debt risk.
- Every desk (FX, OTC, Structured) runs approvals differently — chaos in process, lost flow. - Introudcing ETT on Steroids! We have designed this out to scale globally alongside with the Murex program and can be ued for all CABS.

**The CADEP Promise:**  


**The Why Value to all functions of the product it serves**  
- Speed: Instant Yes/No/Maybe signals.  
- Transparency: Pre-trade limits exposed in trader screens.  
- Consistency: One approval logic across desks.  
- Client Impact: Faster quotes, higher hit rates, stronger retention.
